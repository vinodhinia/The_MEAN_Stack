/**
 * Within the member function, we can get access to the current instance using this even though the same function body is shared between all instances.
 * The reason should be obvious from our earlier discussion on this and the calling context.
 * It is because we call a function on some instance, in other words, instance.someMemberFunction().
 * That is why inside the function this will refer to the instance used.
 * The main difference here vs. the revealing module pattern is that functions are shared between all the instances and donâ€™t take up memory for each new instance.
 * This is because functions are only on .prototype and not on this. Most classes inside core Node.js are written using this pattern.

// Creation
var instance = new someClass();

// Usage 
console.log(instance.someProperty); // some initial value
