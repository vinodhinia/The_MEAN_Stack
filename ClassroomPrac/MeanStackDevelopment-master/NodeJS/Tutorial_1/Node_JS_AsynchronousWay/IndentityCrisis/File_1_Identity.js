/**
 * What happened? Most of the time, when you have a function nested within another,
 * it inherits the scope of its parent/host function and should have access to all the same variables.
 * So why does the nested callback function not get the correct value for the filename property?
 *
 * The problem lies with the this keyword and asynchronous callback functions.
 *
 * Don’t forget that when you call a function like fs.open, it initializes itself,
 * calls the underlying operating system function (in this case to open a file),
 * and places the provided callback function on the event queue.
 *
 * Execution immediately returns to the FileObject#file_exists function, and then you exit.
 *
 * When the fs.open function completes its work and Node runs the callback,
 * you no longer have the context of the FileObject class anymore,
 * and the callback function is given a new this pointer!
 *
 * The bad news is that you have, indeed, lost your this pointer referring to the FileObject class.
 *
 * The good news is that the callback function for fs.open does still have its function scope.
 *
 * A common solution to this problem is to “save” the disappearing this pointer in a variable
 * called self or me or something similar.
