<!--In this example we have an ol element to denote an ordered list and use the ng-repeat directive on an
li element to generate list items for each to-do. I use the ng-if directive,
which I applied in a previous example to control the inclusion of a span element
for those to-do items that are complete.-->
<ol>
    <li ng-repeat="item in todos">
        {{item.action}}
        <span ng-if="item.complete"> (Done)</span>
    </li>
</ol>
