         * The Angular dependency management sub-subsystem took care of that for us behind the scenes.
         * This technique is an aspect of something known as dependency injection,
         * a relatively involved topic that is beyond the scope of this session.
         * For now, though, it is enough to know that asking for a service in this way,
         * as opposed to you declaring and instantiating it yourself within your controller code,
         * is a major benefit. That being said, you will get a little more insight into
         * the mechanism at play here when we create our own service in the next section.
