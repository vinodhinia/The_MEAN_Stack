<!--All that we have done here is to move the ngApp directive out of the opening HTML element
and place it on the first paragraph element. We also added another paragraph element,
which is almost identical to the first. However this one is without an ngApp directive.
Two interesting things happen:
The first interesting thing is that the expression binding in the first paragraph worked just as it did before.
Even though we relocated the ngApp directive, the expression binding is still nested within its boundaries and, therefore,
still under AngularJS control.
The second interesting thing is that the second paragraph uses an expression too.
 However, this expression binding simply renders as is; it is not evaluated at all.
 AngularJS simply isnâ€™t interested in it, because it is not contained within the boundaries of an ngApp directive.
  In fact, AngularJS has no knowledge of this particular paragraph element or anything contained within it.-->
