<!--In the first line of the program, we have the HTML5 doctype.
Though this is not strictly necessary for AngularJS to work, it is the doctype you should be using for today’s rich Internet applications.
The second line is where it becomes interesting.
We have declared an ngApp directive within the opening HTML element.
We use ngApp to let AngularJS know which element is to be considered the root of the application.
As we have declared it within the HTML element, we are declaring that the whole document is to be “under the control” of AngularJS.
Moving down to the fifth line, you can see that we have included the AngularJS library using the script element.
If we didn’t include the AngularJS library, we wouldn’t see any AngularJS goodness.
Now for something very exciting: if you move down to the eighth line, you will see an AngularJS expression,
as delimited by the opening and closing double curly braces—{{ and }}.
We keep things nice and simple here and concatenate the two string literals 'Wor' and 'ld'.
AngularJS expressions are powerful, and you will see many of them in this book.
Here we use one in a somewhat contrived way, simply to illustrate how they are put into action.
The interpolated value is, of course, the string World.
When we place an expression between double curly braces like this, we create an expression binding.
In a nutshell, this means that the value of the expression is bound. Anytime it changes, the binding will update too.
Bindings and expressions will be second nature to you in no time, as these are at the core of how AngularJS works.
