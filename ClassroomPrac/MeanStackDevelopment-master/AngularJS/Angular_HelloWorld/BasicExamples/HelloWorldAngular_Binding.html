<!--Here we have declared the expected ngApp directive and AngularJS script reference with which, it is hoped, you are already comfortable.
 The two important lines are the two lines contained within the body element.
The first declares a standard HTML text input, but with one very important addition—the ngModel directive, which we have assigned the value of city.
The second line, via an expression binding, uses this value to reference the text that the end user enters into the text field. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>

<head>
    <title>Binding Example</title>
    <script src="../../bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

<label>City: </label><input ng-model="city" type="text" /></label>
<p>You entered: {{city}}</p>
 <pre> This is where the magic starts to happen.
    Start typing into the text field and watch as the text in the paragraph below the text field updates in real time.
    What makes it so magical is the amount of code that it took to achieve this result—not very much code at all, no?
    It's not really magic, of course. At least not in the Harry Potter sense.
    However, something very sophisticated is clearly taking place.
    Already, we can see that AngularJS must be hard at work for us, monitoring the application for data changes,
    updating the DOM to show these changes to the end user, and other things that we are yet to encounter.
    Other frameworks require that you tackle some or all of this work yourself. AngularJS wants you to focus on your primary concern-your application,
    not its plumbing.
    Another interesting point is that we didn’t actually write any JavaScript code!
    You will find that AngularJS has a strong lean toward a declarative, as opposed to a procedural, coding style.
    Obviously, you have to write JavaScript at some point or other, but AngularJS encourages you to put this in the right parts of your application.
    As you might expect, a good portion of this book will look at just what constitutes these "right parts."</pre>
