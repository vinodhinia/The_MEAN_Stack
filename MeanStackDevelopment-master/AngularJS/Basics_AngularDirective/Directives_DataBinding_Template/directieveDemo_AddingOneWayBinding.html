    Data items will go here...
    <!-- One way data binding example -->

    <!-- This is the most natural and expressive way of creating data bindings:
    The bindings are easy to read and fit naturally into the content of HTML elements.-->
    <div>There are {{todos.length}} items</div>



    <!--has the same effect but requires an additional element -->
    <!--The ng-bind directive does allow you to hide your template markup when the HTML content
    is shown to the user before it is processed by AngularJS
    (because browsers donâ€™t display attribute values to users),
    but this is rarely a problem and is addressed by the ng-cloak directive -->
    <div>
        There are <span ng-bind="todos.length"></span> items
    </div>


    <!--If you need to create multiple data bindings, then you should use the ng-bind-template directive-->
    <div ng-bind-template = "First: {{todos[0].action}} Second: {{todos[1].action}}">
    </div>


    <!--The drawback of the inline bindings is that AngularJS will find
    and process every set of {{ and }} characters in your content.
    This can be a problem, especially if you are mixing and matching JavaScript toolkits
    and want to use some other template system on a region of HTML
    (or if you just want to use double-brace characters in your text).
    The solution is to use the ng-non-bindable directive,
    which prevents AngularJS from processing inline bindings-->

    <div ng-non-bindable>
        AngularJS uses {{ todos[0].action }} characters for templates
    </div>

    <!--One way data binding changes end -->
