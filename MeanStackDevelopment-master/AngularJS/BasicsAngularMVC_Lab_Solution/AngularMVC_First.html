<!--Perhaps the most important aspect of Listing 3-3 is how we use a scope object,
an instance of which, as we discussed, was passed into our controller function by the framework.
It really is quite fundamental to how AngularJS does much of its work.
We can already see it being used to decouple the model from the view, but it actually does something
a little bit more impressive than keep our code clean and modular.
It is also a key player in the frameworkâ€™s ability to keep the model and the view in sync with each other.
The changes made to the model were immediately
reflected in the view; we did not have to do any Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.
