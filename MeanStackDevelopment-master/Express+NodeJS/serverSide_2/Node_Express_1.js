/**
 * One of the nice things about the app now is that you no longer need
 * to parse the incoming requests or parameters; express does all this for you.
 *
 * So, whereas before you had to include the url module to parse the incoming URL,
 * itâ€™s now ready for you right when you get to the routing functions.
 *
 *
 * Similarly, you never need to parse GET query parameters because they are also prepared for you in advance.
